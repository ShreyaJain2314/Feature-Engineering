# Feature-Engineering

The code shows a data preprocessing and logistic regression modeling pipeline for the Titanic dataset, which is a common dataset used for binary classification tasks (predicting survival or not survival in the Titanic disaster). Let's break down what's happening in the code step by step:

Data Loading: The code starts by loading two datasets: train and test from CSV files. These datasets typically contain information about passengers on the Titanic, with the train dataset having the target variable 'Survived' (1 for survived, 0 for not survived).

Data Exploration and Visualization:Various data exploration and visualization tasks are performed:
    Checking the counts of values in the 'Cabin' column.
    Filling missing values in the 'Age' column with a placeholder value (-0.5).
    Creating bar plots using Seaborn to visualize relationships between features and the target variable 'Survived' (e.g., gender, passenger class, age group).
    
Feature Engineering: 
    Age is binned into groups (e.g., 'baby', 'child', 'adult') using the pd.cut function.
    Columns 'Ticket', 'Fare', and 'Cabin' are dropped from the dataset as they are not used for modeling.
    Missing values in the 'Embarked' column are filled with 'S'.

Creating Title Feature:
    Titles are extracted from the 'Name' column using regular expressions.
    Titles are then categorized into common groups (e.g., 'Mr', 'Miss', 'Mrs') and rare titles are combined into 'Rare'.
    Some titles like 'Mlle' and 'Mme' are mapped to 'Miss' and 'Mrs', respectively.
    The 'Title' feature is then mapped to numeric values.
    
Imputing Missing Age Values Based on Title: The code attempts to impute missing age values based on the mode (most frequent) age group for each title category.

Label Encoding: Label encoding is applied to categorical features ('Sex', 'AgeGroup', 'Embarked') using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn.

Model Training and Prediction: A logistic regression model (LogisticRegression) is trained on the preprocessed training data (xtrain and ytrain).

The model is used to make predictions on the test data (xtest).The predictions are stored in a DataFrame along with the 'PassengerId'.
